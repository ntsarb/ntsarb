# About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on testing out different graph RAG approaches and implementations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build RAG and Agentic AI systems.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I had been programming computers since the age of 12 and, in 1992, I enrolled in my Informatics studies at the University of Piraues (Athens, Greece). A few months later, I pitched the idea of the Internet to my parents, explaining its potential and asking whether they could help me raise funds to build the first ISP in Greece. They responded: don't do anything stupid! Focus on your academic studies; only a few computer geeks may ever want to connect their computers to a network!
