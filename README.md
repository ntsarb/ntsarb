## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**ntsarb/ntsarb** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on testing out different graph RAG approaches and implementations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build RAG and Agentic AI systems.
- âš¡ Fun fact: In 1992, I had just started by studies in Informatics, at the University of Piraues (Athens, Greece). I went to my parents, explained what the Internet would become, and asked whether they could help me raise funds to build the first ISP in Greece. They responded: don't do anything stupid! Focus on your academic studies; only computer geeks like yourself may ever want to connect their computers to a network!
